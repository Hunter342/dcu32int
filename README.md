# NOTE 1:

I marked those platforms which I checked. The utility also supports other platforms, for example: OSX32, Linux64, iOS Simulator, iOS Device 32, iOS Device 64.

# NOTE 2:

The prefix "<u>no code</u>" means that you will not get an assembler-like function code at the output, unfortunately, the author did not do this in his utility, and, alas, my knowledge in this area is not enough :)

However, the source codes are open, you are free to study them as much as you want, maybe you can do it :)

# NOTE 3:

If you'd like to try parsing a file with a version that I haven't tested, please share your analysis with me. I will update the information based on the results of your analysis of the files.
